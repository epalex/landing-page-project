# landing-page-project
## Frontend Mentor, the landing page project

This challenge is to build out a landing page from the designs provided.
The users should be able to:
  * view the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
  * see hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## my notes
* create a custom `README.md`
* submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see
* share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the slack community
* blog about your experience building your project.
  Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned
